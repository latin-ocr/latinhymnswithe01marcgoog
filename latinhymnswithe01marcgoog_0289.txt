continued in use among Protestants These hymns were the first
original poetry os the peoplc in the Latin language, unless, per-
haps, those critico may be right who think they find in Livy a
prose rendering oi earlier ballads. The so·called classic poetry
was an echo of Greace, both in substance and form‚the matter and
meters were both imitated, and the poems were eomposed ior the
lovers of Grecian art in the Roman court. It did not sp'ring from
the people, and it never moved the people. But the Christian
hymns were proper solk poetry‚ the “ Bible of the people”—their
llomeric pocms. Their making was not so much speech as action.
Legends described some os tho best of them as thc inspired acts
of Christian heroes. They were in substance festive prayers‚ the
simplest rhythmio oilering of thanks and praise to the giver of
light and of rest, both natural and spiritual, at morning and
evening, and at other sessons suited to the remcmbrance and
rhythmical rehearsal of the truths of the Bible. Aiicrvvard they

and then they became the utteranoe of the brooding love and saith
of contemplative piety; and finally the elaborate ingenuity of
monastic scholarship dressed up any thing and every thing re-
ligious in these poetical forms. In these later times the same
scholare rcwrote the rude old hymns into correct and polished
metere for the use of the Latin Church. The singing was at first ’
by the whole congregation, but in later times the music has be-
come too difficult, and trained choirs and accompanying instru-
ments are necessary ior the service.

The language oi the early hymns is the common speech of the
day, deeply colored by Bible idiom. It has very much the same
relation to that os the Augustan books which Bunyan has to Ba·
con or Milton. It does not differ from that os the odes os Hor-
