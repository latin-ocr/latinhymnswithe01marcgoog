aud for vigor, lmrmony, and simpliuity of lang-iuge,
the Hymna are better than any Augustum Odes. They
are the true Iatiu fulk poemsg they have been called
“the Bible uf the people.”

They ure a vnlnable study nizo from the biograph-
ical, lfistorieal, and liberm-‚y mntter that comes up in

' reading them. The authors are many of them the hor

roes of their genemtion, kings iu tho malma of thought
οι· aetion. Iuterestiug events are connected with their
composition or history, und they aro full of allusion to
the great works of the olden- period, ὼε Bible and the
fathers οἱ the Glmmh. Thena is great variety in the
subjecta, the mecei-s, and the style df the hymns.
